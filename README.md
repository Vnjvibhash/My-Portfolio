# My-Portfolio
This project is a versatile and visually engaging project card system designed to showcase various projects with a dynamic and interactive interface. Each project is displayed using a Card widget, featuring an image carousel, project details, and a rating system.

This app serves as a dynamic showcase of my recent work and projects, providing a user-friendly and visually engaging experience. Here’s what makes it stand out:

✨ Interactive Project Display: Each project is presented in a beautifully designed card format, featuring an image carousel, detailed description, and rating. The use of a card-based UI not only enhances visual appeal but also improves usability.

🔍 Tech Tags: Tags associated with each project are displayed with relevant icons, giving users quick insights into the technologies and tools used.

🌐 Seamless Integration: With a built-in web view feature, users can effortlessly explore the project URLs directly from the app.

📱 User Experience Focused: The app is designed with a clean, intuitive interface to ensure a smooth and engaging experience.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to apply my skills in Flutter and Firebase, and I’m incredibly proud of the result. Check out the app and let me know what you think!
